This project investigates the long-run economic and educational consequences of malaria in Sub-Saharan Africa, a region historically excluded from the World Health Organization’s 1955 Global Malaria Eradication Programme (GMEP). While eradication campaigns in the Americas and South Asia generated large human capital and income gains, Africa was considered too poor for large-scale intervention. This institutional decision contributed to the continent’s sustained malaria burden and unequal global health outcomes.

Using a country-year panel from 2000 to 2023 and a difference-in-differences framework, we estimate the effect of baseline malaria exposure on GDP per capita and schooling outcomes. After incorporating validated exogenous controls for agricultural structure and political stability, we find no significant aggregate effect of pre-2005 malaria endemicity on post-2005 development outcomes. However, additional analyses reveal meaningful heterogeneity. Insecticide-treated mosquito nets are consistently associated with higher income and education levels, while antimalarial drug treatment shows weaker or negative associations. Effects also differ sharply by income group. Poorer countries experience substantially larger benefits from both prevention and treatment, which contradicts the historical belief that low-income settings yield limited returns to malaria control.

These findings highlight the developmental value of preventive vector-control strategies, the need to target high-burden low-income countries, and the importance of strong institutions for effective program delivery. The project reframes malaria eradication as a long-term development investment and provides open-source data and code for further research.
