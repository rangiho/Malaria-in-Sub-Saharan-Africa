**Overview**

This repository contains my empirical analysis of malaria’s long-run economic and educational impacts in Sub-Saharan Africa. Motivated by the historical exclusion of Africa from the 1955 Global Malaria Eradication Programme (GMEP), I study whether early malaria burden continues to influence GDP per capita and schooling outcomes today.

I use a country-year panel from 2000 to 2023 and apply causal inference techniques, robustness checks, and intervention-specific analysis to understand how malaria prevention and treatment shape development trajectories.

**Research Questions**

Does baseline malaria endemicity (pre-2005) predict long-run economic or educational outcomes?

Do malaria interventions (mosquito nets, antimalarial drugs, vector control) generate observable development gains?

Are effects heterogeneous across income groups?

Does the historical decision to bypass Africa in GMEP continue to shape inequality today?

**Data Sources**

Malaria burden: Malaria Atlas Project (incidence, prevalence, mortality)

Economic outcomes: World Bank World Development Indicators

Institutions: Worldwide Governance Indicators

Climate & Geography: FAO, WDI

Education: UNESCO Institute for Statistics

Sample excludes Cabo Verde due to missing malaria data.

**Methods**

I estimate a series of models including:

Panel econometrics with country and year fixed effects

Difference-in-differences using pre-2005 endemicity

Robustness checks with lagged controls

Intervention-specific regressions (ITNs, treatment coverage, IRS)

Income-group heterogeneity analysis

I also validate agricultural and institutional controls using exogenous climate and governance measures.

**Key Findings**

Baseline malaria burden shows no significant aggregate effect on GDP or schooling after 2005.

Mosquito nets are strongly associated with higher income and education levels.

Drug-based treatment shows weaker or sometimes negative associations.

Low-income countries experience the strongest gains, contradicting the historical belief that they do not benefit from eradication efforts.

Results highlight the importance of prevention-focused strategies and institutional capacity.

**Interpretation**

The absence of strong aggregate effects does not imply malaria is irrelevant for development. Instead:

Preventive vector control plays a critical role.

Interventions must be targeted toward low-income high-burden countries.

Malaria eradication should be treated as a development investment, not only a health policy.
